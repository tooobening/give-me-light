### Final Project Proposal
1. **Persona/Scenario**
    1. **Persona**
        * Potential travelers: the ones who are just planning their next trip for northern lights  in North America.
        * Public: the ones who are interested in northern lights worldwide or in data visualization.
    2. **Scenario**
        * _Scenario:_ Upon entering the website, the user reads an introduction to the northern lights and he is encouraged to explore the distribution of northern lights close to a user specified location in North America. He becomes curious about what could be watched nearby home so he types in Madison. After clicking on the search button, he jumps to a map and flies to Madison. He identifies some clusters where the photos of northern lights were taken close to Madison by Flickr users. On the side panel for advanced options, he finds two statistical graphs. The first one is a donut chart that shows the frequency of each dominant color of northern lights within the extent. The user learns that green is the most frequent color. The donut chart is actually a filter controlled by attribute (the dominant color). The user clicks on green and blue to turn them off on the map. The second graph is a histogram showing the total number of photos taken in each month within the extent. The user finds the trend of the northern lights frequency throughout the year. The histogram also works as a filter controlled by time (binned by month). The user clicks on all bars except for March so that only photos taken in March remain on the map. He clicks on one cluster to retrieve the photos in a new side panel. He checks on the options of sorting the photos by views (from most to least) and dates (from newest to oldest), and gets amazed at a stunning photo on the top. He clicks on the photo to zoom into the location on the map and pans to find it very close to Mackinaw City in North Michigan, a good place to stay overnight if he goes for the beautiful blue northern light during the spring break. He clicks on the location and then the navigate button to open directions in Google Maps to calculate the route from his home to the destination.

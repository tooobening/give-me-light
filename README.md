### Final Project Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona
        * Potential travellers: the ones who are just planning their next trip for northern lights  in North America.
        * Public: the ones who are interested in northern lights worldwide or in data visualization.
    2. Scenario
        * Scenario #1: Upon entering the website, the user reads an introduction to the northern lights. He is encouraged to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of the northern lights in North America. On the map he identifies where the photos of the northern lights were taken by flickr users, as well as the dominant color of the northern lights in each photo, which is represented by the dot color. The user also finds two statistical graphs below the map. The first one is a donut chart that shows the proportion of each dominant color, and the user learns that green is the most frequent color. He clicks on green and blue to filter them out on the map. The second graph is a histogram showing the total number of photos taken in each month, and the user learns the trend of the northern lights frequency throughout the year. He clicks on all bars except for December and January to filter the northern lights occurring in these two months only.
        * Scenario #2: Upon scrolling down the webpage, the user is encouraged to find out where he should go if he wants to see the northern lights close to him. He types Madison when asked to enter a specific location. He clicks on purple and drags the tips on the month bar to filter his search within March. After clicking on the submit button, he jumps to another page with a map that identifies 5 clusters of points most close to Madison. He pans and zooms in to one of them which locates nearby a small town, and clicks on the cluster to retrieve the photos in an information panel on the left of the page. In the panel he checks on the option of sorting the photos by views, and gets amazed at the top stunning photos. He finds out that Mackinaw City in North Michigan would potentially be the best place to go if he hopes to see purple northern lights during his spring break. He drops a marker on the destination and clicks on the navigate button to find the shortest route from Madison to the destination.
